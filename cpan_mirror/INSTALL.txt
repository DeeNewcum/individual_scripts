Before running, you should install these.

If running on Cygwin, install these packages:

    - libcrypt-devel


Finally, install all the Perl packages:

    cpan CPAN::Mini MetaCPAN::Client Number::Bytes::Human CGI::Tiny JSON::XS Text::LineNumber YAML::XS

    (on Cygwin, you may need to "Run as administrator" to the terminal first)
